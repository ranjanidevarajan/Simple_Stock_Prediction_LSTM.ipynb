📈 Simple Stock Market Prediction using LSTM
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in Python with Keras and TensorFlow, presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

🔍 Features
Uses historical stock price data via yfinance

Applies Min-Max scaling for preprocessing

Builds and trains a simple LSTM model

Predicts and visualizes stock closing prices

🛠️ Technologies
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Keras & TensorFlow

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

yFinance

📂 Dataset
Data is fetched automatically using the yfinance API. You can modify the stock ticker and date range in the notebook.

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download this repo

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install yfinance tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
Open Simple_Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells

📊 Output
The notebook will display graphs comparing actual vs predicted closing prices for the selected stock.
